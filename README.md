## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aave-portfolio-dashboard.git
cd aave-portfolio-dashboard
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage

1. **Select Network**: Choose from the supported networks in the sidebar
2. **Enter Address**: Input any EVM-compatible wallet address
3. **Analyze Portfolio**: Click "Analyze Portfolio" to fetch and display data
4. **Review Results**: Examine portfolio overview, risk metrics, and position details

### Key Metrics Explained

- **Health Factor**: Ratio determining liquidation risk (below 1.0 = liquidation risk)
- **Utilization**: Percentage of collateral being used for borrowing
- **LTV (Loan-to-Value)**: Current borrowing ratio against collateral
- **Liquidation Threshold**: Maximum LTV before liquidation occurs
- **Net APY**: Combined yield from supplies minus borrow costs

## API Integration

This dashboard uses the official Aave V3 GraphQL API:
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.v3.aave.com/graphql`
- **Data**: Real-time user positions, market data, and account health metrics
- **Rate Limits**: Standard API rate limits apply

### Development Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add type hints for new functions
- Include docstrings for public methods
- Test across multiple networks before submitting

## Limitations

- **Public Data Only**: Only displays publicly available blockchain data
- **API Dependency**: Requires Aave API availability
- **Network Coverage**: Limited to supported Aave V3 markets
- **Rate Limits**: Subject to API rate limiting during high usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid address format"**
- Ensure address starts with `0x` and is exactly 42 characters
- Verify the address is a valid EVM address

**"No data found"**
- Check if the address has positions on the selected network
- Try different networks where the user might be active

**"API request failed"**
- Verify internet connection
- Check if Aave API is experiencing downtime
- Try again in a few moments

### Performance Tips

- Use specific networks where you know positions exist
- Avoid rapid consecutive requests to prevent rate limiting
- Clear browser cache if experiencing display issues

## Security & Privacy

- **No Private Keys**: Only requires public wallet addresses
- **Read-Only**: Cannot execute transactions or access private data
- **No Data Storage**: Does not store user addresses or portfolio data
- **Public API**: Uses official Aave public endpoints
